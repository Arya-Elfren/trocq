# Getting started

## Getting the right setup

This artifact contains an implementation of the Trocq parametricity framework as
a plugin for the Coq proof assistant. As such, we offer several possibilities
for the reader, according to their level of familiarity with the ecosystem and
interest in our work for their own use. All methods were tested on Linux and
macOS, we therefore recommend that the reader use one of these operating
systems.

### Via VSCode and Docker (recommended)

In this set-up, the reader considers this code mainly as the artifact for our
paper, and thus wants to check it is working properly. To that end, we propose
to interact in an easy way with a Docker container containing our code. The main
requirement for the reader is to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) installed on their machine. You also
need to ensure you have more than 6GB of disk space available.

Here are the instructions:
- Make sure your VSCode has the [Dev
  Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
  extension by running `code --install-extension
  ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers` or from the menus.
- Clone or download the repository of the [Trocq
  plugin](https://github.com/coq-community/trocq), e.g.
  `curl -L -O https://github.com/coq-community/trocq/archive/master.zip && unzip master.zip`
- Run VSCode in it (e.g. `code trocq-master`) and immediately after opening it
  will suggest to "Reopen in Container", click this (otherwise type F1 and
  "Reopen in Container").
- Wait for VSCode to download a 1.28 GB archive that extracts to about 6 GB, on
  our system this takes about 2 min.
- Wait for VSCode to compile the code of the plugin, this takes about 30s.

### Via Nix (recommended only for nix/nixos users)

  1. First install nix https://nixos.org/download
  2. Add the [cachix](https://docs.cachix.org/installation) repository `coq-community`
  ```shell
  nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install
  cachix use coq-community
  ```
  3. Clone the current repository and type `nix-shell`
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/coq-community/trocq.git
  nix-shell
  ```
  4. You may also use `nix-build` to build it and reuse it as a nix package.

### Via Opam (recommended only for ocaml/coq/opam users)

  1. Install [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)
  2. Install the custom version of `coq-elpi`
  ```shell
  opam pin add coq-elpi https://github.com/ecranceMERCE/coq-elpi/archive/refs/heads/strat.tar.gz
  ```
  3. Build Trocq
  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/coq-community/trocq.git
  cd trocq
  make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine>
  ```
  4. You can also run `make install` to install Trocq on your system.

## Exploring the examples with VSCode

After completing the **Getting the right setup** phase above, the `examples`
folder can be unfolded and the files can be inspected by clicking on them.

When a file is clicked, it is displayed and a `Goals` tab opens. It shows the
state of step-by-step execution of the file by Coq. The main actions related to
the Trocq plugin are the `Trocq Use` commands feeding the database of the
plugin, and the `trocq` tactic actually performing the expected proof transfer
step.

One can check that this tactic is working as expected by clicking right before
it in the Coq file, waiting for Coq to execute the file until the pointer and
update the proof state in the `Goals` panel, then clicking right after the dot
after `trocq` and waiting for the proof state to be updated with the associated
goal generated by Trocq to replace the initial one. Please note that on the
first time a line is clicked in a file, the proof state can take a few seconds
to update.

### Example from the artifact paper

In file `artifact_paper_example.v`, this amounts to putting the pointer on line
38 column 7 (counter visible on the bottom right-hand side of the editor), then
on line 38 column 14 and checking the updated goal is the expected one (in this
particular case, featuring `nat` in the associated goal instead of `N` in the
initial goal).
