# Trocq

This repository contains Trocq, a modular parametricity plugin for proof transfer in Coq.

NB: it relies on a [custom version of Coq-Elpi](https://github.com/ecranceMERCE/coq-elpi/tree/strat), mainly changing its behaviour regarding the translation of universe variables between Elpi and Coq.
