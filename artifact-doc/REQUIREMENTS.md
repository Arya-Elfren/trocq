# Recommended requirements

In this set-up, the reader considers this code mainly as the artifact for our
paper, and thus wants to check it is working properly. To that end, we propose
to interact in an easy way with a Docker container containing our code. The main
requirement for the reader is to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) installed on their machine. You also
need to ensure you have more than 6GB of disk space available.
