# Requirements

According to the path you want to follow there are different sets of
requirements.

## Using github codespaces

You need to have remaining minutes of usage in your Codespaces plan.
Unless you are often using Codespaces for free, this requirement
should be met.

## Using VSCode

The main requirement is to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) installed on their machine.
VSCode must have permission to run Docker. You also need to ensure
you have more than 6GB of disk space available.

## Using opam

You need to have [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)
properly installed.

## Using nix

You need to have either the nix package manager installed on your
system (Linux, MacOS, WSL2) via https://nixos.org/download or a NixOS
linux distribution.
